Evan Miya Metrics Analysis

This EDA script explores the implementation and predictive power of Evan Miya's team-level metrics
for NCAA basketball tournament prediction.

Analysis objectives:
1. Understand and calculate key Evan Miya team metrics (Relative Ratings, Opponent Adjustment, etc.)
2. Evaluate the predictive power of these metrics for tournament outcomes
3. Compare different metrics to determine which are most valuable for tournament prediction
4. Guide feature engineering for our neural network model

Output:
- Visualizations of metrics distribution and correlation with tournament success
- Statistical analysis of which metrics best predict tournament advancement
- Recommendations for feature engineering in our prediction model
