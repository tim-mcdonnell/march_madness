# Milestone: ESPN API Data Acquisition System

## Objective

Develop a robust and reliable system for acquiring data from the ESPN API to power the NCAA March Madness Predictor.

## Description

This milestone focuses on creating a complete data acquisition system that connects to ESPN's API endpoints, fetches NCAA basketball data, validates it according to our schema requirements, and stores it in our DuckDB database. This system is the foundation of our entire prediction pipeline, as it provides the raw data for all feature calculations and model training.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Direct API connections to all required ESPN endpoints
- [ ] Complete data validation framework ensuring data quality
- [ ] Efficient data storage in DuckDB with appropriate schema
- [ ] Error handling and retry mechanisms
- [ ] Rate limiting to avoid API restrictions
- [ ] Caching system to minimize redundant API calls
- [ ] Recovery mechanism for interrupted downloads
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage of all components
- [ ] Complete documentation of the API client and its usage

## Tasks

### Core Tasks

- [ ] **API Client: Core HTTP Client Implementation** - Create the base HTTP client with authentication and request handling
- [ ] **API Client: Endpoint Definitions** - Define interfaces for all required ESPN API endpoints
- [ ] **API Client: Response Validation** - Create validation system for API responses
- [ ] **Database: Schema Definition** - Define database schema for raw API data
- [ ] **Database: Storage Implementation** - Implement storage of API data in DuckDB
- [ ] **Pipeline: Data Acquisition Stage** - Create pipeline stage for end-to-end data acquisition
- [ ] **Testing: Unit Tests** - Develop comprehensive unit tests for all components
- [ ] **Testing: Integration Tests** - Create integration tests for the full data acquisition process
- [ ] **Documentation: API Client Documentation** - Document the API client component
- [ ] **Documentation: Usage Examples** - Create examples of how to use the data acquisition system

### Optional Tasks

- [ ] **Performance: Parallel Download** - Implement parallel downloading capability
- [ ] **Analysis: API Data Explorer** - Create a simple tool to explore raw API data
- [ ] **Monitoring: Data Quality Dashboard** - Build a dashboard for monitoring data quality
