# Feature Implementation: T01 - Win Percentage

## Description

Implement the Win Percentage feature (T01) that calculates the percentage of games won by each team, with breakdowns by home, away, and neutral site games.

## Feature Details

**Feature ID:** T01  
**Category:** team_performance  
**Complexity:** 1  
**Feature Definition:** Win percentage is calculated as the number of games won divided by the total number of games played. For a team with W wins and L losses, the win percentage is W/(W+L).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Win percentage is calculated correctly for all teams
- [ ] Home, away, and neutral site win percentages are calculated separately
- [ ] Feature handles edge cases (no games played, perfect record)
- [ ] Unit tests verify correct calculation for various scenarios
- [ ] Data quality tests validate output range (0.0-1.0) and completeness
- [ ] Feature documentation is created following the template
- [ ] FEATURES.md is updated to show implementation status
- [ ] Performance benchmarking shows calculation completes in under 5 seconds for the full dataset

## Implementation Details

### 1. SQL Implementation

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW feature_T01_win_percentage AS
SELECT 
    team_id,
    season,
    COUNT(*) AS games_played,
    SUM(CASE WHEN team_winner = true THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS wins,
    SUM(CASE WHEN team_winner = true THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*)::FLOAT AS win_percentage,
    -- Home win percentage
    SUM(CASE WHEN team_home_away = 'home' AND team_winner = true THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / 
        NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN team_home_away = 'home' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 0)::FLOAT AS home_win_percentage,
    -- Away win percentage
    SUM(CASE WHEN team_home_away = 'away' AND team_winner = true THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / 
        NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN team_home_away = 'away' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 0)::FLOAT AS away_win_percentage,
    -- Neutral site win percentage
    SUM(CASE WHEN neutral_site = true AND team_winner = true THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / 
        NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN neutral_site = true THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 0)::FLOAT AS neutral_win_percentage
FROM team_box
JOIN games ON team_box.game_id = games.game_id
GROUP BY team_id, season;
```

### 2. Feature Dependencies

This feature depends on:
- `team_box` table with `team_id`, `team_winner`, and `team_home_away` columns
- `games` table with `game_id` and `neutral_site` columns

### 3. Performance Considerations

- Use appropriate indexes on `team_box.game_id`, `team_box.team_id`, and `games.game_id`
- Consider materializing this view if it's queried frequently

## Testing Requirements

### 1. Unit Tests

Implement tests that verify:
- Win percentage calculation is correct for teams with different records
- Home/away/neutral breakdown calculations are correct
- Edge cases are handled correctly:
  - Teams with perfect records (100% wins)
  - Teams with no wins (0% wins)
  - Teams with no games in a particular location (NULL for that location percentage)

### 2. Data Quality Tests

Implement tests that verify:
- Win percentages are between 0.0 and 1.0
- No NULL values in win_percentage column
- All teams in the team_box table are represented in the output
- Sum of wins and losses equals games_played

### 3. Test Data

Create test data including:
- Teams with mixed records
- Teams with games in all three location types
- Teams missing certain location types
- Teams with extreme records (all wins, all losses)

## Documentation Requirements

- [ ] Update FEATURES.md to change status to "Implemented" with link to implementation file
- [ ] Create feature documentation in docs/components/features/team_performance/T01_win_percentage.md
- [ ] Document SQL implementation details and any performance optimizations
