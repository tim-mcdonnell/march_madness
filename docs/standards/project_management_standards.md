# Project Management Standards

## Overview

This document outlines the project management standards for the NCAA March Madness Predictor project. These standards ensure consistent planning, execution, and tracking of work across the project.

## Project Structure

### 1. Milestones

Milestones represent significant achievements or deliverables in the project. They serve as checkpoints to measure progress and organize work.

**Characteristics of Good Milestones:**
- Represent a meaningful, cohesive body of work
- Have clear, measurable completion criteria
- Align with project goals and architecture
- Have a defined timeframe
- Comprise a logical set of related tasks

**Milestone Documentation:**
- All milestones must be documented using the [Milestone Template](templates/milestones/milestone_template.md)
- Milestone status should be reviewed weekly

### 2. Tasks

Tasks are the atomic units of work that contribute to milestones. Each task should be focused on a specific piece of functionality or work.

**Characteristics of Good Tasks:**
- Clearly defined scope
- Specific acceptance criteria
- Reasonable size (typically 1-5 days of work)
- Assigned to a specific person
- Associated with a milestone

**Task Documentation:**
- All tasks must be documented using the appropriate task template:
  - [Feature Task Template](templates/tasks/feature_task_template.md) for feature implementations
  - [Bug Fix Template](templates/tasks/bug_fix_template.md) for bug fixes
  - [Performance Task Template](templates/tasks/performance_task_template.md) for performance optimizations
  - [Component Task Template](templates/tasks/component_task_template.md) for component implementations

## Workflow

### 1. Planning Process

1. **Milestone Planning**
   - Define milestone objectives and success criteria
   - Break down milestones into tasks
   - Prioritize tasks within milestones
   - Assign timeframes and dependencies

2. **Task Planning**
   - Define task requirements and acceptance criteria
   - Specify implementation approach
   - Identify testing and documentation requirements
   - Estimate effort
   - Assign tasks to team members

### 2. Execution

1. **Task Status Tracking**
   - Tasks move through these statuses:
     - **To Do**: Planned but not started
     - **In Progress**: Work has begun
     - **Review**: Work is complete and ready for review
     - **Done**: Work is complete, reviewed, and accepted

2. **Status Updates**
   - Team members update task status daily
   - Progress is discussed in daily standup meetings
   - Blockers are identified and addressed promptly

3. **Task Completion**
   - Task is considered complete when all acceptance criteria are met
   - Code review is passed
   - Tests are implemented and passing
   - Documentation is updated

### 3. Review and Retrospective

1. **Milestone Reviews**
   - Conducted at the completion of each milestone
   - Review achievement of success criteria
   - Identify learnings and areas for improvement

2. **Project Retrospectives**
   - Conducted monthly
   - Focus on process improvements
   - Update documentation and standards based on learnings

## Prioritization

### 1. Priority Levels

Tasks are prioritized using these levels:

- **Critical**: Required for project viability, blocks other work
- **High**: Important for project success, significant impact
- **Medium**: Valuable but not critical
- **Low**: Nice to have, can be deferred

### 2. Prioritization Factors

When prioritizing tasks, consider:

- Dependency relationships
- Value to project goals
- Urgency
- Resource availability
- Risk

## Time Management

### 1. Estimation

- Tasks should include effort estimates in hours or days
- Estimates should consider:
  - Implementation complexity
  - Testing requirements
  - Documentation needs
  - Review process

### 2. Timeboxing

- Use timeboxing for research and exploratory tasks
- Set clear time limits for specific activities
- Re-evaluate approach if timeboxes are exceeded

## Quality Standards

### 1. Definition of Done

A task is considered "Done" when:

- Implementation meets all acceptance criteria
- Code follows project coding standards
- Tests are written and passing
- Documentation is complete and accurate
- Code review is passed
- Changes are merged to the main branch

### 2. Code Review

All changes must be reviewed according to:

- [Coding Standards](coding_standards.md)
- [Testing Standards](testing_standards.md)
- [Documentation Standards](doc_standards.md)

## Documentation

### 1. Required Documentation

Every project component must have:

- Design documentation
- Implementation documentation
- Usage examples
- Testing documentation

### 2. Documentation Updates

Documentation must be updated:

- When requirements change
- When implementations change
- When new patterns or approaches are established
- After significant refactoring

## Tools and Templates

### 1. Project Management Tools

- GitHub Issues for task tracking
- GitHub Projects for milestone and project planning
- GitHub Pull Requests for code review

### 2. Templates

- All documentation must use the templates provided in the `docs/standards/templates/` directory
- New templates may be proposed and added as project needs evolve
