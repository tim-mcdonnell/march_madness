# Core Development Principles

This document outlines the fundamental principles that guide our development process for the NCAA March Madness Predictor project. These principles inform our standards, workflows, and decision-making.

## 1. Data Integrity

### Goal
Every transformation preserves data accuracy and relationships.

### Principles
- Data must be validated at every boundary crossing
- All data transformations must be reversible or traceable
- Data lineage must be preserved and documented
- Schema changes must be explicitly versioned

### Metrics
- Zero data inconsistencies between input and output states
- Complete validation coverage for all data operations
- All data can be traced to its original source

## 2. Reproducibility

### Goal
Any process can be repeated with identical results.

### Principles
- All operations must be deterministic
- Random elements must use fixed seeds when appropriate
- All dependencies must be explicitly versioned
- Environmental variables must be documented and controlled

### Metrics
- Same inputs always produce same outputs
- Any analysis can be reproduced from documentation
- Feature calculations are consistent across runs

## 3. Observability

### Goal
System behavior is transparent and easy to inspect.

### Principles
- Comprehensive logging at appropriate detail levels
- Clear error messages with actionable information
- Instrumentation for performance monitoring
- Explicit state transitions

### Metrics
- Any failure can be diagnosed from logs alone
- System state can be understood at any point
- Performance bottlenecks can be identified

## 4. Modularity

### Goal
Components can be developed, tested, and replaced independently.

### Principles
- Clear interfaces between system components
- Single responsibility for each component
- Explicit dependencies
- Loose coupling between modules

### Metrics
- Changes to one component don't cascade unexpectedly
- Components can be tested in isolation
- New implementations can replace existing ones

## 5. Code Quality

### Goal
Code is readable, maintainable, and robust.

### Principles
- Clear, consistent coding style
- Comprehensive documentation
- Thorough testing
- Error handling at appropriate boundaries

### Metrics
- High test coverage
- Low cyclomatic complexity
- Consistent formatting
- Documentation coverage

## 6. User-Centric Design

### Goal
The system focuses on user needs and experiences.

### Principles
- Features prioritized by user value
- Clear, actionable outputs
- Transparent methodology
- Accessible interfaces

### Metrics
- Feature alignment with user stories
- Actionable predictions with clear explanations
- Intuitive bracket visualization

## Standards Implementation

These principles are implemented through specific standards documents:

- [Coding Standards](standards/coding_standards.md)
- [Testing Standards](standards/testing_standards.md)
- [Documentation Standards](standards/doc_standards.md)
- [Data Quality Standards](standards/data_quality_standards.md)

## Development Process Implementation

Our development process implements these principles through:

- [Development Workflow](guides/development_workflow.md)
- [Feature Creation Process](guides/feature_creation.md)
- [Testing Guide](guides/testing_guide.md)
- [Code Review Process](guides/code_review.md)

## Applying These Principles

When making decisions, ask yourself:

1. Does this preserve data integrity?
2. Can this be reproduced exactly?
3. Can we observe and understand what's happening?
4. Does this maintain clean component boundaries?
5. Does this maintain or improve code quality?
6. Does this address real user needs?

If you can answer "yes" to these questions, your work aligns with our core principles.
