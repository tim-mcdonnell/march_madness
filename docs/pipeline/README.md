# Pipeline Documentation

This directory contains documentation about the NCAA March Madness Predictor's pipeline architecture and components.

## Purpose

The Pipeline documentation is designed to:
- Explain the overall pipeline architecture
- Detail individual pipeline stages and their interactions
- Provide technical information about pipeline configuration and execution

## Contents

- **[Pipeline Overview](overview.md)**: High-level overview of the pipeline architecture

## Note

This directory is part of the Technical Reference. For a more comprehensive understanding of the pipeline architecture, please also refer to the following resources:

- [Pipeline Usage Guide](../user_guide/pipeline_usage.md): Task-oriented guide for using the pipeline
- [Data Stage](../reference/pipeline/data_stage.md): Details about the data processing stage
- [Feature Engineering Stage](../reference/pipeline/feature_stage.md): Information about feature engineering
- [Model Stage](../reference/pipeline/model_stage.md): Documentation about model training and prediction

**Note**: This directory structure is being reorganized. In the future, all pipeline technical reference documentation will be consolidated under `docs/reference/pipeline/`.
