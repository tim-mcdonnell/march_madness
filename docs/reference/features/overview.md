# March Madness Predictor Feature Overview

This document outlines the features for our prediction model, inspired by Evan Miyakowa's approach and adapted to our available data. Each feature will be built using our processed data files and will serve as input to our neural network model.

## Feature System Structure

Features are now implemented following a standardized approach:

1. Each feature is implemented as a class that inherits from `BaseFeature`
2. Features are organized by category in separate directories
3. Features follow the naming convention `[ID]_[feature_name].py`
4. Features are automatically discovered and loaded at runtime

For implementation details, see:
- Feature implementation template: `src/features/core/base.py`
- Feature Registry: `src/features/core/registry.py`
- Feature Loader: `src/features/core/loader.py`
- Feature Data Manager: `src/features/core/data_manager.py`

For usage information, see the [Features Documentation](../../features/index.md).

## Implementing a New Feature

To add a new feature:

1. Create a file in the appropriate category directory:
```
src/features/[category]/[ID]_[feature_name].py
```

2. Implement a class that inherits from BaseFeature:
```python
from src.features.core.base import BaseFeature

class MyFeature(BaseFeature):
    id = "X01"
    name = "My Feature"
    category = "my_category"
    description = "Description of what my feature does"
    
    def calculate(self, data):
        # Calculation implementation
        return result_df
```

3. Create documentation:
```
docs/features/[category]/[ID]_[feature_name].md
```

4. Update the FEATURES.md registry with implementation status
