# Task Writing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to write clear, actionable tasks and milestones for the NCAA March Madness Predictor project. Well-structured tasks are essential for efficient development, collaboration, and project tracking.

## Task Writing Principles

### 1. Clarity

Tasks should be clear and unambiguous. Anyone on the team should be able to understand what needs to be done without additional context.

### 2. Actionability

Tasks should be immediately actionable, with no ambiguity about how to begin work.

### 3. Measurability

Tasks should have clear completion criteria, making it obvious when they are finished.

### 4. Atomicity

Tasks should be focused on a single, coherent piece of work. If a task feels too large or unfocused, it should be broken down into smaller tasks.

### 5. Context

Tasks should include necessary context and links to relevant documentation or related tasks.

## Task Types

Different types of work require different task structures. Below are common task types in our project:

### 1. Feature Implementation

Tasks for implementing new prediction features.

### 2. Component Development

Tasks for building or enhancing system components.

### 3. Bug Fixes

Tasks for addressing bugs or issues.

### 4. Performance Optimization

Tasks focused on improving performance.

### 5. Documentation

Tasks for creating or updating documentation.

### 6. Research

Tasks for researching new approaches or technologies.

### 7. Data Analysis

Tasks for analyzing data and extracting insights.

### 8. Model Development

Tasks for developing machine learning models.

## Task Structure

All tasks should follow this general structure:

### Title

A brief, descriptive title that clearly identifies the task. Format: `[Task Type]: [Brief Description]`

### Description

A concise description of what needs to be done.

### Acceptance Criteria

Specific conditions that must be met for the task to be considered complete.

### Implementation Details

Technical details or guidelines for implementation.

### Testing Requirements

What tests should be created or updated.

### Documentation Requirements

What documentation should be created or updated.

## Task Templates

We provide templates for different task types. Use these as starting points when creating new tasks.

### Feature Implementation Task

Use [Feature Task Template](../standards/templates/tasks/feature_task_template.md) for implementing new prediction features.

### Bug Fix Task

Use [Bug Fix Template](../standards/templates/tasks/bug_fix_template.md) for fixing bugs or issues.

### Performance Optimization Task

Use [Performance Task Template](../standards/templates/tasks/performance_task_template.md) for performance improvements.

## Milestone Structure

Milestones are collections of related tasks that represent a significant achievement or release. Use the [Milestone Template](../standards/templates/milestones/milestone_template.md) when creating new milestones.

### Milestone Components

1. **Objective**: Clear statement of what the milestone achieves
2. **Success Criteria**: Measurable criteria for milestone completion
3. **Tasks**: List of tasks included in the milestone
4. **Dependencies**: Other milestones or external factors this depends on
5. **Timeframe**: Estimated duration or deadline

## Examples

### Example Feature Task

See [Example Feature Task](../standards/templates/tasks/example_feature_task.md) for a complete example of a feature implementation task.

### Example Milestone

See [Example Milestone](../standards/templates/milestones/example_milestone.md) for a complete example of a milestone.

## Task Writing Workflow

1. **Identify Need**: Determine what work needs to be done
2. **Select Template**: Choose the appropriate task template
3. **Fill Template**: Complete all sections of the template
4. **Review**: Ensure the task meets all quality criteria
5. **Assign**: Assign the task to a team member or milestone

## Common Pitfalls

- **Too Vague**: "Improve database performance" vs. "Optimize team_box query performance by adding appropriate indexes"
- **Too Broad**: "Implement feature engineering" vs. "Implement win percentage feature (T01)"
- **Missing Acceptance Criteria**: Clear completion criteria are essential
- **Implicit Assumptions**: Don't assume knowledge of context or requirements
