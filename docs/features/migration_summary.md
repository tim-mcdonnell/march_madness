# Feature Migration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the work completed to migrate features from the old foundation builders to the new feature system. The new system organizes features by category, implements them as classes inheriting from `BaseFeature`, and provides automatic discovery and registration.

### Advanced Team Features

| ID | Feature | Status | Implementation | Documentation |
|----|---------|--------|----------------|---------------|
| A01 | Offensive Efficiency | ✅ Migrated | [src/features/advanced_team/A01_offensive_efficiency.py](../../src/features/advanced_team/A01_offensive_efficiency.py) | [docs/features/advanced_team/A01_offensive_efficiency.md](../features/advanced_team/A01_offensive_efficiency.md) |
| A06 | Home Court Advantage | ✅ Migrated | [src/features/advanced_team/A06_home_court_advantage.py](../../src/features/advanced_team/A06_home_court_advantage.py) | - |

## Feature Dependencies

The new system supports feature dependencies, as demonstrated by:

- **A01: Offensive Efficiency** depends on **P01: Possessions**
- **P04: Total Rebound Percentage** depends on **P02: Offensive Rebound Percentage** and **P03: Defensive Rebound Percentage**
- **P05: Turnover Percentage** depends on **P01: Possessions**

## Migration Process

For each feature, the migration process involved:

1. Creating a new feature class that inherits from `BaseFeature`
2. Implementing required attributes (id, name, category, description)
3. Implementing the `get_required_data()` method
4. Implementing the `calculate()` method
5. Adding dependency handling where needed
6. Creating comprehensive documentation

## Documentation Structure

For each migrated feature, we created documentation following a standardized format:

1. Overview
2. Description
3. Implementation details
4. Formula/Calculation
5. Data Requirements
6. Implementation Notes
7. Interpretation
8. Usage Examples
9. Visualization suggestions
10. Related Features
11. Version History

## Next Steps

All planned features have been successfully migrated to the new feature system. The next steps would be to:

1. Create documentation for features that currently don't have detailed documentation
2. Implement the remaining features from the feature list
3. Develop additional tests for the migrated features

## Benefits of the New System

The new feature system provides several advantages:

1. **Modularity**: Each feature is self-contained and can be developed independently
2. **Discoverability**: Features are automatically discovered and registered
3. **Dependency Management**: Features can depend on other features
4. **Standardization**: Consistent interface and implementation patterns
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for each feature
6. **Testability**: Features can be easily tested in isolation
7. **Extensibility**: New feature categories can be added without modifying existing code
